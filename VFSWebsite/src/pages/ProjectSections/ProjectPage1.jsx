    description: `
This competition challenges university students to design, build, and operate an electric-powered remote-control vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. 

The goal is to promote hands-on experience with eVTOL and advanced air mobility (AAM) technology, preparing the next generation of engineers and innovators in unmanned aircraft systems.

    title: "Student Design Competition (SDC)",
    description: `
The Vertical Flight Society (VFS) Student Design Competition (SDC) is an annual aircraft design competition that challenges students to innovate and engineer cutting-edge vertical lift solutions. 

As the VFS at UCI Chapter, we proudly sponsor a team of undergraduate students to compete in this competition, providing them with the opportunity to apply their aerospace engineering knowledge to real-world design problems. 

Winning teams are awarded a cash stipend, as well as an invitation to present their designs at the Vertical Flight Societyâ€™s largest Annual Forum and Technology Display. The competition aims to encourage education and careers in vertical flight with rotating sponsorship between Airbus, The Boeing Company, Bell, Leonardo Helicopters, Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Co.; and US Army Research Lab.
